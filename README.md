# pypark

A 2d tile-based theme park simulator written in Python.

The idea of this project is to discover how 2D tile-based engines work and is mostly a testing ground for figuring out different (interesting) problems. It is unlikely this will become an actual game at any point, although it may resemble one eventually.

This was a project that I recently rediscovered after years of gathering dust. It required some love so I'm currently working on it in my (limited) spare time.

# TODO
- more cleanup!
- fix weird dependencies between objects, especially when drawing
- proper entrypoint and python packaging
- properly implement camera viewport and movement
- create testing framework
- make peeps walk to destination
- update this readme :P
- add fun at somepoint?
- so much more
